## Other tips
✔️ Always buy the 10 W-Tad daily – you'll get 50+ back in return.
✔️ You can cheaply reroll the three options until you get high priority skills
✔️ If your power is lower than the strongest Shellshock member in the node, place inside a blue node instead to maximize your % win rate.  % of fights won = more points

## Change skill order after completing the daily Shadow Fight!
➤ Optimal order is different each war!  keep an eye out for instructions once we know what the order will be this`;

## Chronicle Requirements
✔️ Attack all bosses with Lu Bu equipped (except the final boss!)
✔️ Final boss: Use Cosmos or Mirror, depending on Rush – Lu Bu NOT required.
✔️ Equip attack gear and form.
➤ No need to use W-Tads to change gear level.
➤ Even if you're invested in farm gear, just equip your attack gear as-is.

Optional Quests:
💡 Earthworm support is highly recommended – you'll earn worm chests + extra damage.
⚔️ Haven't pushed in the main game for a while?
➤ Dung Week is a great time to use W-Tads to swap from farming mode to push mode!`;
