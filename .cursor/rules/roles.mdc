# Discord role changes

When **adding, renaming, or removing** any Discord role (especially species war / team roles):

1. **Read `docs/ROLES.md` first.** It lists every file and every role reference.
2. **Update every listed location** in a single change so the bot stays consistent and no errors are sent to Discord.
3. **Update `docs/ROLES.md`** if you add new role references or rename/remove roles, so the doc stays accurate for the next change.

Common places that must stay in sync:

- `commands/role-commands.js`: `ROLE_CHANNEL_MAPPING`, `TEAM_ROLE_MAPPING`
- `commands/war-draft-commands.js`: `findRole()` calls and the `roles` object for `generateWarMessage()`
- `war-message-templates.js`: strategy section and `roles.*` usage
- `commands/war-commands.js`: `findRole()` calls and `switch(floor)` role arrays

Use the checklist at the bottom of `docs/ROLES.md` before finishing.
